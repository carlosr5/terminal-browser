<h2>Pre-Intro Setup to Run</h2>
Clone the repository, then type `make clean all` to make the object files and `./browser` to run the program. You interact with the program in the same terminal you run the commands in.
<h2>Introduction and Purpose</h2>
Hello! At the time of making this, I am a sophomore CS student at the University of Southern California! This is a personal project meant to explore topics covered in class that were skimmed over that I'd like to cover more, as well as to gain experience working on a relatively large project from scratch. At the time of making this, I've only taken the following CS classes:
<ul>
  <li>Intro to Programming</li>
  <li>Discrete Maths for Computer Science</li>
  <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
</ul>
This project was meant to explore Linear Algebra as applied to Computer Science, one-way hash functions, and creating/managing larger projects from stratch, as briefly mentioned above. To satisfy the first two items, I chose to incorporate a basic Page Rank function and SHA-256 encryption, both built using online guides and lecture notes where applicable. As a side effect, I also further explored file streams, bit manipulation, and OOP.

<h2>Limitations and Alternatives</h2>
Given that this is programmed in only C++ and that it's in a terminal, it won't look as good as a full fledged web-app built with Angular and Typescript, NodeJS, MongoDB, and all the accompanying libraries and helpful things that come with web development. I'm learning web development, so I'd like to come back to this using all the skills I would have learned by then to make a solid project. For the moment, however, this C++ program has been a nice side quest to work on.

<h2>Skills Improved</h2>
I haven't finished this project at the time of writing this (as I've yet to do PageRank and the actual interface), so this repository partially serves to hold me accountable, and also so I can transfer my code to a faster computer to work on. At the moment, here are some takeaways:
<ul>
  <li>SHA-256 Encryption</li>
  <ul style="padding-left:20px">
    <li>Bit Manipulation</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Page Rank Algorithm</li>
  <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
  <li>File Database</li>
  <ul style="padding-left:20px">
    <li>File Streams</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

Thank you for looking at this repository! Feel free to message me at carlosr5@usc.edu to leave any feedback!
